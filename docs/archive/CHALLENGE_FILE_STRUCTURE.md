## 📄 FILE BREAKDOWN

### 1️⃣ **`challenge-config.json`** - Configuration & Metadata

**Purpose:** Store all challenge settings, status, and metadata

**Created:** When challenge is created (POST /api/challenges)

**Structure:**
```json
{
  "id": "python-learning-2025",
  "name": "Master Python in 90 Days",
  "type": "learning",
  "agent": "accountability-coach",
  "goal": "Become proficient in Python for data science",
  "start_date": "2025-12-27T00:00:00.000Z",
  "end_date": "2026-03-27T00:00:00.000Z",
  "daily_hours": 2,
  "available_slots": [
    "Morning (8-12pm)",
    "Evening (5-9pm)"
  ],
  "punishments": [
    {
      "id": "punishment-1",
      "type": "streak_break",
      "trigger": {
        "type": "streak_days",
        "value": 3
      },

## 🔄 HOW FILES WORK TOGETHER

### **Daily Workflow:**

```
Morning:
1. User opens app
2. Sees current challenge in sidebar
3. Checks BACKLOG for today's tasks

During Day:
4. Works on tasks from BACKLOG
5. Marks completed in BACKLOG
6. Takes notes in ACTIVITY LOG

Evening:
7. Does Daily Check-in (via UI or chat)
8. System writes to ACTIVITY LOG
9. Updates streak in challenge-config.json
10. Checks if punishment should trigger
11. Moves completed BACKLOG items to "Done"
```

### **Weekly Workflow:**

```
End of Week:
1. System generates WEEKLY SUMMARY in ACTIVITY LOG
2. User reviews PLAN progress
3. Updates BACKLOG priorities for next week
4. Archives completed BACKLOG items
```

### **Monthly Workflow:**

```
End of Month:
1. Review PLAN milestones
2. Update challenge-config.json if timeline changes
3. Generate progress report from ACTIVITY LOG
4. Adjust PLAN if needed
```

## 📊 FILE RELATIONSHIPS

```
challenge-config.json
       ↓
   (Metadata)
       ↓
    plan.md ←→ backlog.md
       ↓             ↓
  (Goals)      (Tasks to do)
       ↓             ↓
       ↓→ activity-log.md
              ↓
        (What actually happened)
```

**Flow:**
1. **Config** defines the challenge
2. **Plan** breaks it down into steps
3. **Backlog** tracks what needs to be done
4. **Activity Log** records what was actually done

## 🎯 UI INTEGRATION

### **Where Users See Each File:**

| File | UI Location | Actions Available |
|------|-------------|-------------------|
| `challenge-config.json` | Challenge settings page | Edit settings, View metadata |
| `plan.md` | `/plan` page | View plan, Edit plan, Ask AI to revise |
| `activity-log.md` | Daily check-in modal, Activity history page | Add check-in, View past activities |
| `backlog.md` | Backlog/Todos page | Add task, Mark complete, Prioritize |

### **Automatic Updates:**

| User Action | Files Updated |
|-------------|---------------|
| Daily check-in | `activity-log.md`, `challenge-config.json` (streak) |
| Mark task done | `backlog.md`, `activity-log.md` (logged) |
| Edit plan | `plan.md` |
| Change settings | `challenge-config.json` |
| Miss a day | `activity-log.md`, `.registry/challenges.json` (streak break) |

---

## 🚀 IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

### ✅ **Currently Implemented:**
- ✅ `challenge-config.json` creation
- ✅ `plan.md` creation
- ✅ `progress.md` creation (basic version)

### ⚠️ **NEEDS TO BE ADDED:**
- ❌ `activity-log.md` creation
- ❌ `backlog.md` creation
- ❌ Rename `progress.md` → `activity-log.md` (or use both)
- ❌ Daily check-in writes to `activity-log.md`
- ❌ Backlog management UI
- ❌ Weekly summary generation

---

## 🔧 REQUIRED CHANGES

### **1. Update Challenge Creation API**

**File:** `ui/app/api/challenges/route.ts`

**Change:**
```typescript
// Current (only 3 files)
await fs.writeFile(path.join(challengeDir, 'challenge-config.json'), ...)
await fs.writeFile(path.join(challengeDir, 'plan.md'), ...)
await fs.writeFile(path.join(challengeDir, 'progress.md'), ...)

// Needed (6 files)
await fs.writeFile(path.join(challengeDir, 'challenge-config.json'), ...)
await fs.writeFile(path.join(challengeDir, 'plan.md'), ...)
await fs.writeFile(path.join(challengeDir, 'activity-log.md'), ...)
await fs.writeFile(path.join(challengeDir, 'progress.md'), ...)
await fs.writeFile(path.join(challengeDir, 'backlog.md'), ...)
await fs.writeFile(path.join(challengeDir, 'punishment.json'), ...)
```

### **2. Create Backlog API**

**File:** `ui/app/api/challenges/[id]/backlog/route.ts`

**Methods:**
- GET: Read backlog
- PUT: Update backlog (add task, mark done, change priority)

### **3. Update Daily Check-in**

**File:** `ui/app/api/challenges/[id]/checkin/route.ts`

**Change:** Write check-in data to `activity-log.md` instead of `progress.md`

### **4. Create Weekly Summary Job**

**File:** `ui/lib/weeklySummary.ts`

**Purpose:** Generate weekly summary and append to `activity-log.md`
